# SEDS Blog Page

These are the starting files used by [Kevin Powell](https://kevinpowell.co) to create a personal blog site for the [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/) DevProjects Challenge, [Create a fast and secure blog using JAMStack](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/create-a-fast-and-secure-blog-using-jamstack-c93coupnxb).

The provided files are finished pages using regular HTML and CSS. The HTML files can be broken down into pieces, and used to build out the different templates and partial files using a templating language of your choice. I used nunjuscks here.

Any addition and removal of blog database will be done through Netlify CMS.

## Tutorial

I used [this video](https://youtu.be/4wD00RT6d-g) for majority of the code changes including using eleventy and netlify cms to make my blog dynamic and deploy it as a fully functional blog.
